      <div><img src="imgs/mshan.jpg" alt="This is an image of Matthew Shan in professional attire"/></div>
      <div><p> Hello! My name is Matthew Shan and I am a Computer Science major
        at Grand Valley State University. An interesting fact about myself is
        that both my parents are Chinese, whereas I was born in Canada and grew
        up in West Michigan. Some of my interests include playing music (such
        as piano, guitar, and ukulele), playing strategy games, and of course,
        coding!  </p></div>
    </div>

    <h1 id="cs"> Why Computer Science? <a style="font-size: .6em;" href="files/mshan-essay.pdf" download> [Download PDF Version] </a> </h1>
    <div class="cs">
      <p>&emsp; Computer Science is a very versatile field and technology has
        become an integral part of our culture due to its wide range of uses.
        Personally, I view technology as a tool to improve the quality of
        people’s life. One example is the invention of the printing press. The
        printing press allowed books to be mass produced, while maintaining an
        affordable price. This invention allowed the common folks to read, which
        gave everyone a chance to educate themselves. Another relevant example
        is the self-driving or autonomous car. I recently read an article from
        <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/blind-man-sets-out-alone-in-googles-driverless-car/2016/12/13/f523ef42-c13d-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story.html">The Washington Post</a>
        that describes a blind man who was given the
        opportunity to test one of Google self-driving cars. Although the
        self-driving car is not yet ready for public use, it has demonstrated
        its future potentials. That being said, how could I personally use my
        degree in Computer Science for technological advancement? I want to use
        my future expertise to help others. Currently, I am considering three
        different potential career choices: Software Development,
        Cyber Security, or Teaching.</p>

      <p>&emsp; Software Development is one of my top career choices that I am
        considering, because I find it very exciting. Today, everyone uses
        software in their daily routines, ranging from the alarm clocks, emails,
        GPS, the operating systems on smartphones, social media, and so on. All
        of those technologies are applied into our lives to satisfy our basic
        needs. Without the help of those technologies, it would be either
        difficult to achieve our daily tasks. Software even has the ability to
        enable us to perform what was previously seen as impossible. As a
        programmer, I find that it is a joy to create something for practical
        use, not only because it is satisfying, but also because somebody else
        could use it to make their own lives easier.
      </p>

      <p> &emsp; Another career choice that I am considering is Cyber Security.
        This career is very important in the field of Computer Science.
        Everybody's sensitive personal data is stored in a database, ranging
        from banking information to social security numbers. It is important
        that a security expert does his best to insure that this information
        will not be compromised. Unfortunately, as technology advances, so will
        illegal methods to exploit it. Security experts must stay up-to-date
        with secure practices in order to prevent hackers from compromising
        users’ data. If I decide with this career choice, I would feel proud
        of knowing each step for the job to work towards the protection of
        millions.
      </p>

      <p> &emsp; The final potential career choice in my mind is to teach. This
        will be an option that I could consider after working for a company for
        a decade or so. With this rich experience in a company, I would like to
        give it back to the community. I have always admired my instructors in
        different ways, especially those who teach Computer Science. While those
        instructors could have picked a different and perhaps more financially
        stable career, they have chosen to impart their knowledge and experience
        to others. This is something that I deeply respect, and I look up to the
        instructors as a role model of our society. If I decide to pursue a
        similar career, I hope that I could give back to the community for what
        those instructors have provided me along with some of my own expertise
        and experiences in the field.
      </p>

      <p> &emsp;After I graduate from college, I plan to use my degree to itself
        fullest. Not only do I want to do something I really enjoy, but also I
        want to be productive in society and be helpful in terms of improving
        the quality of lives of others. As we see, the past and present have
        demonstrated how important technology has been in assisting our daily
        routines. By taking on the career of either Software Development, or
        Cyber Security, or Teaching, I believe that I can achieve my own goal of
        assisting others and that I can be a contributing member of our own
        society.

    <h1 id="school"> My Journey in Detail </h1>
    <div class="school">
      <h2> Classes in current semester: Winter 2018 <button id="showNow"><b>[-]</b></button></h2>
      <div id="now">
        <h3> CIS 241: System level programming and Utilities </h3>
        <p>CIS 241 is one of the classes I can take after CIS 163. In this
          class, we learn the programming language C and use of the operating
          system Linux. I always enjoy learning a new language and new
          strategies used in programming. I have always wanted to familiarize
          myself with the Linux operating system. I have heard several good
          things about it and this class is the first time I have a chance to
          work with it. </p>

        <h3> COM 201: Speech </h3>
        <p>Speech is a bit different from my other classes; however, I recognize
          its importance and its values. For anything that human beings do
          together, it is vital that we communicate properly. In the field of
          Computer Science, communication is key, as most work is accomplished
          through teamwork. Even if a person is an excellent coder, yet, he lack
          communication skill, it would be difficult to successfully complete a
          project with others. </p>

        <h3> MTH 225: Discrete Structures 1 </h3>
        <p>Discrete Structures 1 is a class centered on applying mathematical
          concepts to Computer Science. In this class, we have been given the
          opportunity of implementing mathematical functions in the Python
          programming language. After learning this language, I now have a bit
          of an appreciation for the language. I look forward to what the rest
          of the semester will offer. </p>

        <h3> HNR 278/279 History of Science 3 & 4 </h3>
        <p>This is the second semester of my Honors Sequence. As mentioned
          <a href="#hos1"> below </a>, I believe that it is important for me to
          understand the scientists in history in order to contribute to future
          science. In this class, topics that are covered range from the Renaissance
          era to the Romanticism era. While I enjoyed learning the thoughts of
          great thinkers such as Aristotle, Dante, and Aquinas during the
          previous semester, I look forward to learning more about how thinkers
          of the early modern era had shaped today’s way of thinking.</p>
      </div>

      <h2> Classes in first semester: Fall 2017 <button id="showPast"><b>[-]</b></button></h2>
      <div id="past">
        <h3> CIS 163: Computer Science II.  </h3>
        <p>CIS 163 was the first Computer Science class that I took at Grand
          Valley State University. In the High School, I had coding experience
          from AP Computer Science, Web and Game Development, and learning in my
          free time. While I have taken a few coding classes in the past, I have
          found myself in awe of the passion all my coding teachers have
          demonstrated. While I have noticed that every professor or teacher who
          taught me has a passion in their fields, I find that there is
          something special about Computer Science instructors. Those instructors
          had many different choices in terms of career paths, yet they have chosen
          the humble jobs as guides for the next generation of coders.
        </p>

        <h3 id="hos1"> HNR 258/259: History of Science 1 & 2 </h3>
        <p>History of Science was the Honors Sequence that I choose for this
          year. I took interest in the History of Science, because I wanted to
          learn about the thought processes of great thinkers before our time,
          to whom we are all in debt to. I believe that studying great
          scientists and philosophers can be quite beneficial in the advancement
          of technology and may serve as useful knowledge in my future career.
          This course covers a wide range from Ancient Greece to the Protestant
          Reformation. Even after one semester of this class, I find myself being
          able to appreciate several sides of an argument.</p>

        <h3> CHI 201: Intermediate Chinese 1 </h3>
        <p>Chinese is a subject field that I am considering to take on as a
          minor. As a U.S. citizen of Chinese descent, I think it is important
          for me to better myself in both my parents’ culture and language.
          While I can speak functional Chinese, I would like to improve my
          reading/writing skills. After taking this class, my perspective on my
          ancestor’s culture has widened.  I am definitely considering to study
          abroad at least one time during my college years, while one of the
          locations I am interested in is China. What touches my heart is the
          diligence and commitment that other Grand Valley students put into
          learning cultures and languages. It was amazing to see people of all
          backgrounds appreciating the other’s cultures. </p>

      </div>
      <h2> Potential Classes for next semester: Fall 2018 <button id="showFuture"><b>[-]</b></button></h2>
      <div id="future">
        <h3> CIS 263: Data Structures & Algorithms </h3>
        <p>From what I know of CIS 263, this class teaches new data structures
          and algorithms in C++. I have worked with C++ in my high school Web
          and Game Development course so I am quite excited to go in-depth with
          the language.  </p>

        <h3> MTH 202: Calculus II </h3>
        <p>Mathematics is a subject that I have always enjoyed. Before college,
          mathematics was my favorite subject. By the time I got to high school,
          I experienced coding for the first time and realized that I could
          apply mathematical thinking to Computer Science. In this class, I look
          forward to learning more about integrals and their applications in the
          real world.</p>

        <h3> MTH 325: Discrete Structures II </h3>
        <p>nce again, I am excited to further carry on my skills in mathematics
          to the next course of Discrete Structures II. My hope is that I can
          use a language such as Python again to help me to learn more in this
          class. </p>

        <h3> Undecided Honors College/ General Education course </h3>
        <p>While currently I do not know which class I will take as a general
          education course, I still look forward to whatever class I may take.
          I strongly believe that it is important to learn a subject outside of
          my own field in order to widen my knowledge and perspective.</p>
